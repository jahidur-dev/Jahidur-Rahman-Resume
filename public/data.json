      "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of data science, new tools emerge daily. However, Structured Query Language (SQL) has remained a constant force since the 1970s. \n\nWhy? Because data lives in relational databases. \n\nWhile AI can generate queries, understanding the underlying logic of joins, window functions, and CTEs is crucial for optimization. In this post, I explore how modern analysts can leverage SQL alongside AI tools to maximize efficiency rather than replacing it."

Perishable goods have a limited shelf life, and overstocking leads to direct financial loss. \n\nWe implemented a Facebook Prophet model to account for seasonality and local holidays. By feeding historical sales data combined with weather APIs, we were able to predict demand with 85% accuracy. This shift from reactive to predictive ordering saved the company significant revenue in Q3."

Focus on the \"Why\": Engineers need to know the business impact of their work. \n3. Shield the team: Protect them from shifting priorities so they can focus on deep work.\n\nThese three pillars have helped me build a high-performing analytics unit."
